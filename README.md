# Local-Air-Quality-Tracker
In the summer of 2023, when the Canadian Wildfires were occuring and the north east of the US experienced a massive drop in air quality due to pollution. I wanted to keep track of the air quality in my area.

For the code to work:
Provide a discord webhook URL in the webhook1 variable.
Provide a langitude and longitude as well in the weather_link.
